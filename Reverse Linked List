Approach1 :  Here we can follow a simple iterative approach. 
        We can keep two pointers, prev and current.
        prev will be used to store the previous node to the current,
        hence prev will start with None, and current will start from head
        As we traverse, we will make a reverse connection from current to previous.
        
        But before making that connection, we have to store the current.next into some
        variable, otherwise after reversing the link, we will loose the next node
        
        In the end when current reaches None, prev will be the last node,
        hence head will be set to prev now
  Time Complexity :O(N) 
  Space Complexity : O(N) 
  class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        curr= head
         while curr != None:
            # storing next connection
            temp  = curr.next
            # reversing link
            curr.next = prev
            
            #switching to next pair
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
         head=prev
         return head
